    head1: 'Architectural design methods are developing in a more scientific and systematic direction. The architectural environment, functional spaces and their construction systems are also in urgent need of integration and quantification; big data and rule-oriented procedural methods provide a scientific dynamic evolution mechanism for the discipline of architecture, forming a disciplinary symbiosis that promotes each other. Its design method needs to find ways to transcend the limitations of existing application software from structural logic algorithms, metaphorically and indirectly connect traditional subject concepts in the digital methods, and use procedural means to reveal patterned solution strategies for design methods to achieving the continuous transformation of digital design methodologies.',

    simformsDesc: 'SIMForms is a creative architectural design platform which integrates parametric modelling and AI image synthesis. It aims to streamline the design workflow by incorporating architectural formality, quantitative metrics, and visual representation into a simplified framework.',
    simformsFea1: 'Input or customize your site to start a design project.',
    simformsFea2: 'Provide dozens of multi-storey/high-rise building styles. Rapidly generate precise 3D model with simple parameters.',
    simformsFea3: 'Generate architectural concept renderings with AIGC, without complex configurations.',

    anysiteDesc: 'AnySite is a digital design tool tailored for the multi-level subdivision of sites, providing assistance in site planning for urban and architectural design processes.',
    anysiteFea1: 'Import the design site and automatically subdivide it based on environmental and contextual considerations.',
    anysiteFea2: 'Multi-level subdivision algorithms of plots are embedded, spanning various scales from urban zones to building sites.',
    anysiteFea3: 'Supporting navigation, modification, and area ratio updates for different levels of plots.',

    nexspaceDesc: '（In Progress）NEXSpace is a typology-oriented comprehensive architectural spatial layout generation application.',
    nexspaceFea1: 'Selecting morphological prototypes for each plot, defined based on topological relationships.',
    nexspaceFea2: 'Automatically optimizing layout models based on site conditions to achieve spatial layout updates.',
    nexspaceFea3: 'Upload the data of function-to-area requirements for automated room allocation and arrangement.',
